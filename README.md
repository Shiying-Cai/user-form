To use the website, users are required to input their name, age, favorite season, and whether they can drive in the form. Once they click the submit button, their submission will be displayed below the form. Users can edit their response by clicking the Edit button. The Reset button will reset the entire page. 

All fields are mandatory and users will receive an alert message and a color indication if any of the required fields are not filled in.
